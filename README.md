Make sure you have python 3.10 or 3.11 installed

2. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare .env file
Copy .env_sample and create .env with your openai api token

`python app.py`

To start frontend

1. Navigate to `/frontend` folder
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. In the file  `.env.development` instead of `VITE_API_HOST = https://docsapi.arc53.com` use `VITE_API_HOST=http://localhost:5001`
